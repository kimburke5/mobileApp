# Mobile Application Development Project
This is a project for the module Mobile Application Development as a part of third year Software Development in GMIT. 
Current Status: waiting for app certification from windows development center

# Design
I created the project using visual studio 2017, it is a Universal Windows Project, programmed through C# and xaml. The application I created was a single page calculator app with the ability to add, subtract, multiply and divide with whole or decimal point numbers.
The app is a well-designed UI that is fit for purpose and provides a good user experience. The app is more than a simple information app. It provides interactivity for the user and has useful functionality. 

# How to clone your repository in Github
1. On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository.
2. Under the repository name, click Clone or download.
3. In the Clone with HTTPs section, click to copy the clone URL for the repository.
4. Open Git Bash.
5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
6. Type git clone, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 2.
7. Press Enter. Your local clone will now be created.

When the repository has been cloned to your local machine, you will need to open it using visual studio 2017 to launch the application.
